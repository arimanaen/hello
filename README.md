Hello
This is Hello Readme from the master branch. 

I think this is good. We are learning how does Git work. 
1. Create a branch from the master (or any branches) 
2. Make changes/updates
3. Create pull request. 
4. Once pull request approved, merge with the master. 
5. Once merged we can remove the branch.
